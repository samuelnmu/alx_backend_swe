Import the random module: At the beginning of your code, add the line import random. This allows you to use functions from the random module, like generating random numbers.
Generate a secret number: Use random.randint(1, 10) to generate a random number between 1 and 10 (you can adjust the range if you want). Store this in a variable called secret_number.
Get user’s guess: Prompt the user to guess the number using input(). Convert the user’s input to an integer using int(). Store this in a variable called guess.
Match the guess:Use a Match Case statement to compare the user’s guess with the secret number:
If the guess is correct, display a message like “Congratulations, you guessed it!”
If the guess is too high, display a message like “Oops, your guess is a bit high. Try again!”
If the guess is too low, display a message like “Nope, your guess is a bit low. Give it another shot!”
Offer to play again: Ask the user if they want to play again using an if statement and user input.
Bonus Challenge:
Add a counter to keep track of the number of guesses the user takes.
Display the number of guesses it took the user to win the game.
